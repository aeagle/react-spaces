## Introduction

**An easy to understand and nestable layout system, React Spaces allow you to divide a page
or container into anchored, scrollable and resizable spaces enabling you to build desktop
type user interfaces in the browser.**

React Spaces allow you to divide a page or container HTML element into spaces. These
spaces know how to behave in relation to each other and can also be divided into further
nested spaces.

The library contains a small number of components which can be used to build more complex
desktop type user interfaces.
