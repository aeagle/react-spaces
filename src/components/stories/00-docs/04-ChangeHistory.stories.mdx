## Change history

### 0.1.24

- Fixed NPM readme
- Added CHANGELOG.md

### 0.1.23

- Fixed generation of head styles height and z-index which were missing a semi-colon.

### 0.1.22

- Added Custom space to allow access to all space properties.
- Allowed false to be returned from onResizeStart event callback to conditionally cancel resize operation.

### 0.1.21

- Added onMouseMove, onTouchStart, onTouchMove and onTouchEnd events.

### 0.1.20

- Moved child state and recalculation of child spaces to the parent space to remove synchronisation issues causing various update issues.
- Moved space styles to document head to generate cleaner mark-up. All spaces now get a auto-generated short ID which can be overriden with the id property on a space.
- Removed the need for an outer and inner container on all spaces except for when a space is resizable and scrollable to allow the space to maintain the resize handle location.
- Optimised touch resize actions preventing default browser actions using css touch-action and changing debounce to throttling on resize updates.

### 0.1.19

- Fix to ensure spaces in same parent are updated when a space zIndex is adjusted.

### 0.1.18

- Added resize start and end events
- Fixed useContext hook being used within condition expression causing 'React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by SpaceInternal' error when zIndex property updated on space.
- Fix to ensure debounced resize (mouse/touch) events do not fire after mouse up or touch end events have fired.
- Fix to ensure mouse up and touch end events are unbound after a resize operation has completed to prevent multiple event handlers being bound on every resize operation.

### 0.1.17

- Fix to ensured resize delta is reset when size property changed on anchored and resizable spaces
- Added PropTypes for all exposed components for Javascript only consumers in addition to the Typescript typings in the library.
- Fix when multiple classes provided as property to space to prevent a duplication of class names on the outer and inner space elements.

### 0.1.16

- Added touch resize functionality.
- Remove old docs from demo project.

### 0.1.15

- Added <Layer /> component and layer support to allow floating of spaces above each other.

### 0.1.14

- Migrated from Webpack to Rollup for building component library
- Created ES module bundles in `/dist/es`
- Fixed window undefined error when rendering spaces via Next.js
- Created server bundle `/dist/server` for using with Node.js server side apps when utilising SSR, e.g. Next.js and seperated styling from server bundle (/dist/server.css). This is currently experimental.

### 0.1.13

- Refactored spaces as functional component using hooks.
- Fixed className type on `<ViewPort />` component.

### 0.1.11 - 0.1.12

- Fix to deal with changes to size and anchor properties on anchored spaces and adjusted spaces accordingly.

### 0.1.10

- Added 'as' property to allow rendered DOM element to be specified (thanks to u/MahNonAnon and u/trevoreyre on Reddit for suggestion of this).
- Added 'centerContent' property as short-hand for centering space content instead of having to introduce the extra `<Centered />` or `<CenteredVertically />` components.
- Allow resize handle width to be specified and also it's placement within space controlled with the 'overlayHandle' property.
- Fixed issue with dynamically added/removed anchored spaces where an anchored space would see itself as a space taking space.

### 0.1.4

- Add support for percentage sizing on anchored spaces

### 0.1.3

- Added readme
- Updated documentation

### 0.1.2

- Removed ResizeSensor from spaces by default and now optionally allow live size updates with trackSize property
